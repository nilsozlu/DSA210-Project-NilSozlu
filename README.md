# Analyzing YouTube Trending Videos: What Makes a Video Go Viral?
## Project Proposal — DSA210 Term Project

### Motivation  
YouTube is one of the largest content platforms worldwide. Every day, thousands of videos are uploaded, but only a few make it to the trending list.  
Almost everyone watches YouTube every day, but have you ever wondered **why some videos suddenly go viral and appear on the trending list while others don’t?**  
In this project, I want to understand what makes a video popular.  
Do people prefer certain categories like music or entertainment?  
Does uploading at a specific time affect views?  
Do likes and comments really show how much people enjoy a video?  

By analyzing YouTube trending videos in Turkey, I hope to find patterns that explain what helps a video reach more people.

### Data Source  
- **Main dataset:** Kaggle — *YouTube Trending Video Dataset* (includes data for Turkey).  
- **Extra data:** YouTube API (for category names).  
All data used will be **publicly available** and contain no personal information.

### Methodology  
1. **Data Collection:** Download the dataset and gather category info from YouTube API.  
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, duplicates, and fix column types.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Top trending categories  
   - Relation between likes, views, and comments  
   - Timing patterns (day of week, publish hour)  
4. **Machine Learning:**  
   - Predict view count or like ratio using regression models  
5. **Visualization & Reporting:**  
   - Use Python libraries (matplotlib, seaborn, pandas) for charts and insights

### Expected Outcomes  
- Identify features that most influence video popularity  
- Compare engagement trends across categories  
- Build a small model that predicts video performance  
- Present insights through clean visuals and simple explanations  

---

### Ethical Considerations  
- Only publicly available, non-personal data will be used  
- All sources will be cited properly  
- Any AI assistance (like writing help) will be documented
