# Analyzing YouTube Trending Videos: What Makes a Video Go Viral?
## Project Proposal ‚Äî DSA210 Term Project

### üí° Motivation  
YouTube is one of the largest content platforms worldwide. Every day, thousands of videos are uploaded, but only a few make it to the trending list.  
In this project, I aim to explore **which factors** (like video category, engagement rate, publish time, or title length) help a video go viral.  
By focusing on trending videos in Turkey, I hope to find meaningful patterns about what viewers engage with most.
